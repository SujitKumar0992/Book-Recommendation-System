# Book-Recommendation-System

## Problem Statement

In some industries, the use of recommender systems is crucial because, when implemented well, they can be extremely profitable and set themselves apart from their competitors. Online book selling websites nowadays are competing with each other by many means.One of the most effective strategies for increasing sales,enhancing customer experience and retaining customers is building an efficient Recommendation system. The book recommendation system must recommend books that are of interest to buyers. Popularity based approach and Collaborative filtering approach are used in this project to build book recommendation systems.

## Solution 
The main objective of this project is to create a Book recommendation system that best predicts user interests and recommend the suitable/appropriate books to them ,using various approaches.For this we use Popularity based and Content Based Approach with Machine Learning
